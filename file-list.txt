Materials in this folder:
JupyterNotebookSlides.ipynb - notebook version of the slides presented at the workshop

JupyterNotebookSlides.pdf - PDF version of the slides. This version is from the December 8, 2020 workshop but contains the same content as the February 2022 workshop.

Opening these materials:
.ipynb files should be opened using Jupyter Notebooks software. The software can be downloaded through Anaconda Individual Edition (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and opened using the Anaconda Navigator interface. Jupyter Notebooks can also be downloaded from Project Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/install) using a command-line interface.

When opening the .ipynb files, the Images folder must be located in the same directory as the notebook files. If the Images folder is outside of the directory, the screenshots and examples will not be displayed.


For futher learning:
For a more in-depth notebook tutorial with screenshots, see Data Services' tutorial here:
