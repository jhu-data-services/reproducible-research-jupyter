# Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks for Reproducible Research
You are already writing comments for your Python code so you may be wondering why you need to document code with a Notebook tool, such as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Notebook tools help you document and share your work with fellow Python coders, non-coders or non-Python coders. This workshop will teach you the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks and will focus on the features of Jupyter Notebooks that help you create reproducible research and code for technical and non-technical audiences. Many Python users choose to document and share code with Jupyter Notebooks, but this tool can also be used with other programming languages, including Julia and R. You can find [examples of Jupyter Notebooks here](https://nbviewer.org/).

JHU Data Services, part of the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries, helps the JHU community find, use, visualize, manage, and share data. We offer live webinars and self-paced online trainings on computational research and coding, GIS, data management, data visualization, and more. [See all of our training topics on our website.](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/training-workshops/)   

This repository contains materials for one of our live webinars open to JHU students, faculty, and staff. Please [contact us](mailto:dataservices@jhu.edu) with any questions.

As of March 2020, Data Services workshops are being held virtually on Zoom. [See our calendar to register for upcoming workshops.](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/training-workshops/calendar/)


## Pre-Class Instructions
Before the class, install Jupyter Notebooks on your computer. The easiest way to install is through the Anaconda Distribution: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).    
If you are comfortable using the command line, you may also install Jupyter Notebooks directly from Project Jupyter: [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install).   

Note: You may use the original Jupyter Notebooks or the newer JupyterLab for this workshop.
